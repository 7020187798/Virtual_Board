# Virtual Board using MediaPipe
Virtual Board using MediaPipe is a computer vision project that allows users to draw and interact with a virtual board in the air using hand gestures. The project utilizes the MediaPipe framework, which provides tools and pipelines for real-time applications with machine learning and computer vision capabilities.
Features
•	Real-time hand detection and tracking using the MediaPipe Hand Tracking module.
•	Gesture recognition to detect specific hand poses for drawing and interaction.
•	Virtual board for drawing and interacting with hand gestures.
•	Adjustable brush size and color for enhanced user experience.
•	Clear board option to reset the drawing surface.
Installation
1.	Clone the repository:
shellCopy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/virtual-board.git cd virtual-board 
2.	Install the required dependencies. Ensure you have Python 3.x and pip installed.
shellCopy code
pip install -r requirements.txt 
3.	Download the MediaPipe Hand Tracking model from the official repository:
shellCopy code
wget https://github.com/google/mediapipe/raw/master/mediapipe/models/hand_tracking_desktop.tflite 
4.	Run the application:
shellCopy code
python virtual_board.py 
Usage
•	Launch the application, and a window will open displaying the live webcam feed.
•	Raise your hand in front of the camera, and the hand detection algorithm will start tracking your hand.
•	Make specific gestures recognized by the application to interact with the virtual board. For example:
•	Open your hand fully to start drawing.
•	Close your hand into a fist to stop drawing.
•	Perform other gestures to change brush size or color (if applicable).
•	Interact with the virtual board using the recognized hand gestures.
•	To clear the board, press the 'C' key on your keyboard.
